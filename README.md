# 🎗️ Cancer Prediction Website - AI-Powered Diagnosis
## 🌟 Transforming Healthcare with AI-Driven Early Cancer Detection
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with early detection being the key to successful treatment. Our **AI-Powered Cancer Prediction Website** is designed to revolutionize the way cancer is diagnosed by integrating **cutting-edge machine learning** and **advanced medical imaging analysis**. By combining **blood test biomarkers** with **MRI scan assessments**, this platform provides an **efficient, accurate, and non-invasive** diagnostic solution. Users can simply **upload their medical reports**, and our AI-driven system will analyze the data to determine **the presence of cancer and its stage**, aiding in early intervention and better patient outcomes.

## 🚀 Key Features
✅ **Upload & Analyze Blood Test Reports** (Images/PDFs) 📄  
✅ **Upload & Process MRI Scans** (DICOM/JPG/PNG) 🖼️  
✅ **AI-Powered Cancer Detection** (Yes/No) 🔍  
✅ **Stage Prediction** (If Cancer is Detected) 📊  
✅ **Seamless User Experience** with an interactive and responsive design 🎨  
✅ **Fast, Secure, and Scalable Cloud-Based Application** ☁️  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios (for modern UI/UX)  
🔹 **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (handling AI & APIs)  
🔹 **Machine Learning:** XGBoost (Blood Test), CNN (MRI Scan) - Model stored in **PKL format**  
🔹 **Image Processing:** OpenCV, Tesseract OCR (for extracting blood test data)  
🔹 **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), AWS/Heroku (Backend), Cloud Storage for file handling  

## 📌 Installation & Setup
